# TODO: Fix Image Upload Paths for Rooms and Addons

-   [x] Update add_room method in AdminController.php to save images to public/images/rooms instead of public/images
-   [x] Verify that add_addons method already saves to public/images/addons (it does)
-   [x] Test the changes to ensure images are uploaded correctly
